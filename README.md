If you have trouble making logo plots, please consider these dependencies:

WebLogo version 3 is written in python. It is necessary to have python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3 or 3.4 and the extension package numpy installed before WebLogo will run. WebLogo also requires a recent version of ghostscript to create PNG and PDF output, and pdf2svg to generate SVG output.

For more information about making logo plots, including links to the required software packages, please see verify you have the items listed under "Dependencies" at http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/manual.html#download
